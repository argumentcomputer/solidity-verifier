# Ethereum Elliptic Curve Libraries: Grumpkin and BN256

## Overview

This folder contains two Solidity libraries, `Grumpkin.sol` and `BN256.sol`, which provide functionalities for 
elliptic curve operations on the Ethereum blockchain.

By using the pair Bn254/Grumpkin in the context of our Nova Verifier, we can leverage the pre-compiled contract available
for `Bn256` to optimize our verification process on the Ethereum chain.

## `Grumpkin.sol`
`Grumpkin.sol` is a Solidity library for elliptic curve operations on the Grumpkin curve. This library includes functions
for basic elliptic curve arithmetic, point manipulation, and cryptographic operations specific to the Grumpkin curve.

### Key Features
- Curve Parameters: Defines crucial parameters such as `P_MOD` (the prime modulus), `R_MOD` (order of the base point), and `B` (curve coefficient).
- Point Operations: Includes functions for point addition (`add`), point doubling (`double`), and scalar multiplication (`mul_by_3b`).
- Specialized Functions: Functions for negating points (`negate`), base points (`negateBase`), and scalars (`negateScalar`).
- Utility Functions: Features like checking if a point is the identity element (`is_identity`) and converting between different coordinate systems (`to_affine`, `decompress`).

## `BN256.sol`
`BN256.sol` is a Solidity library focused on the BN256 elliptic curve, widely used in cryptographic applications. It *
heavily relies on the pre-compiles already available on the network.

### Key Features
- Curve Constants: Defines constants `P_MOD`, `R_MOD`, and `B` for the BN256 curve.
- Elliptic Curve Arithmetic: Functions for point addition, doubling, and scalar multiplication specific to BN256.
- Curve Point Management: Functions for negating points and scalars, as well as verifying curve points.
- Conversion Utilities: Includes functionality for compressing and decompressing points on the curve.
